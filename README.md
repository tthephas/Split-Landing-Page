# Split-Landing-Page

Create a webpage look where the right and left side come into view better on a mouse over hover.

Similar to an ecommerce site, if you hover over one picture, it enlarges and shows more clear while the other shrinks.

As you move to the other, the opposite happens and the other picture takes over.

Using mostly CSS and some JS for this.
